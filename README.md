## Strategy
The first step taken by the team was to define the strategy through a "Value Proposition Canvas," used to align the user needs with the proposed solution. This process allowed us to clearly identify our target market—high school students facing challenges in choosing their future career—and develop a product tailored to their realities. From the canvas, we observed key alignments such as the “fear of making the wrong choice” and the corresponding feature “comparison tools with objective data.” This connection helped us understand how to support users through clarity and personalization. Other early ideas, like integrating external advising networks, were discussed but ultimately not prioritized in the current version. This strategic process helped ensure the solution is not only functional but directly addresses the students' pains, gains, and real decision-making contexts.

## Scope
The application is designed for high school students who are exploring their future careers and need support in making informed decisions. It is suitable for students with clear interests as well as those who are still uncertain. It provides step-by-step guidance through vocational tests, career exploration tools, and scholarship information. It allows users to reflect on their strengths, compare study options, and access relevant, real-world data. It also considers different user contexts and motivations, ensuring the experience feels personal and supportive. In short, it is a versatile application that helps students navigate their academic choices with clarity and confidence.
