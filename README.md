## 1. Introduction

### 1.1. **The Problem**

> What if I‚Äôm just wasting my time?  
> What if I disappoint my family with my decision?  
> Will I earn enough to make a living?

High school students in Chile face significant challenges when choosing their academic and professional paths. Existing vocational guidance platforms offer fragmented information across multiple websites, with overwhelming interfaces and technical language that create unnecessary barriers.

In a survey conducted with 40 students at Escuela Amanecer, **52.5%** stated that external opinions directly influence their vocational decisions, and **75%** said they are not aware of any online tools for academic program guidance. Platforms like *MiFuturo* or the Ministry of Education‚Äôs websites were not mentioned, revealing a lack of access to key information‚Äîand a strategic opportunity.

## 3. Strategy

### 3.1. Value Proposition Canvas

*How we aligned student needs with our solution*

**Dual approach:**

1. **Students with clear options:** Exploration and comparison tools with up-to-date information.
2. **Lost or undecided students:** Vocational guidance test to narrow down options, plus a random degree explorer.

**Identified gaps:**

- **Social:** External pressure on decision-making.
- **Emotional:** Insecurity, fear of failure, or disappointing the family.
- **Technical:** Lack of attractive and integrated guidance platforms.

### 3.3. Benchmarking 

To develop an application that truly meets the needs and expectations of high school students seeking vocational guidance, it was essential to analyze existing platforms ‚Äî including both direct competitors and indirect references known for good design and usability.

The goal was to identify the strengths and weaknesses of current solutions, both functionally and visually, in order to incorporate best practices and avoid common pitfalls.

#### Types of platforms analyzed:

- üéì **Direct competitors**: Platforms such as *MiFuturo* or *EligeCarrera*, which provide educational program information.
- ‚öñÔ∏è **Visual comparison tools**: Services like *QuePlan* or *ComparaOnline*, valued for their clarity and organization.
- üñºÔ∏è **Aesthetic references**: Apps like *Airbnb*, known for their modern and minimalistic user experience.

![Customer Journey Map](./assets/customer-journey-map.png)

#### 4.1.1. Decision Stage Interfaces

**Customer Activities**

The user explores key features of Vocaci√≥n360 ‚Äî comparing degree programs, discovering scholarships and benefits, and taking diagnostic tests. A key interface here is the academic program comparison screen, which lets users generate a downloadable table comparing two programs and their universities.

![Compare degree programs](./assets/hd-compare-academic-programs.png)

**Customer Goals**

The user‚Äôs goal is to identify the academic path that aligns best with their interests and abilities. To support this, Vocaci√≥n360 offers interest, strengths, and skills tests. These identify the user‚Äôs strongest areas and provide a list of recommended programs at the end of each test. The results can be downloaded locally.

![Test Result](./assets/hd-test-result.png)

**Touchpoints**

The website interface is the primary point of contact with high school students. The home screen plays a key role, with a background in cool tones designed to inspire reflection and convey calm for students who may feel lost, anxious, or overwhelmed by the need to explore their true vocation and make decisions about their future.

## 6. Skeleton

### 6.1. Low-fidelity wireframes

The wireframes developed represent an approximation of the structure and design of the interfaces associated with the committed functionalities. The main navigation between screens is carried out through a top navigation bar, which is present across all system interfaces.

In general terms, the interfaces can be grouped into three main thematic categories:

üß≠ Interfaces Related to degree programs
These interfaces prioritize the use of tables to display structured and repetitive information, such as the characteristics and attributes of degree programs. Additionally, pie charts are used to present contextual information related to the composition of students enrolled in a program, as well as the academic weighting requirements needed to apply.

üìù Interfaces Related to Tests
These interfaces follow a minimalist and straightforward design, centered around Likert-scale questions that allow users to express degrees of agreement or disagreement. The test results are presented using pie charts that show the user's affinity with different areas of knowledge, along with a concise description and clear recommendations. The goal is to ensure that users can easily understand the results through precise and actionable information.

üéì Interfaces Related to Student Benefits
The information is organized into three main sections. In each section, the benefits available to users are presented with a brief description and links to official platforms. A filter bar is included to allow students to explore the available benefits based on their interests. The main objective is for users to clearly identify what benefits they can access, their type, and where to go for more information.

### 7.1. Interface Evolution

## Interface Evolution Process: Explanations and Key Reasons for Modifications

In the initial versions of the interface, we included a top navigation bar with the following options: Home, Undergraduate Programs, Benefits, Points of Interest, About Us, and Login/Register. However, as we refined the project's scope, we decided to remove "Points of Interest" and temporarily disregard the Login/Register functionality. This was because user login would only provide access to test history‚Äîsomething that we replaced by allowing users to download their results for free, without requiring registration. Nonetheless, we do not rule out including this feature in future versions.

Our second consideration was the target audience: high school students seeking vocational guidance. These young users are often confused or overwhelmed, and requesting them to create an account or enter personal information at the outset might discourage them from engaging further, so we chose to simplify access as much as possible.

Additionally, between the wireframes and the final prototype, we made adjustments to margins and spacing to better align with web design standards seen in similar informational websites. These changes improve readability and the overall browsing experience.

In our competitive benchmarking, we prioritized a cool color palette aligned with thoughtful decision-making. We also introduced value-added tools compared to our competitors: the ability to compare degree programs and download test results for free.

Finally, the survey conducted at a public high school revealed that most students didn't know where to find information about scholarships and financial aid. To support them at this critical stage, we created the "Benefits" section, which compiles scholarships from international, municipal, and private institutions. It includes filters by university, admission scores, and tuition fees, and provides direct links to each program's official site. This feature reflects our belief that financial factors play a key role in students' decisions to apply for a degree.

**Home Interface Evolution**

The original home wireframe offered options for taking tests, exploring programs, and searching scholarships. In the high-definition version, a minimalist design was adopted with fewer visible buttons and a calming forest background in blue and turquoise tones. The navigation bar became collapsible, featuring a subtle orange hover effect.

![Home Interface Evolution](./assets/home-interface-evolution.png)


**Academic Program Interface Evolution**

The academic program view originally used side menus, but was redesigned with top navigation buttons for greater consistency across sections. In the specific section on weightings, a donut chart was added to visually display the percentage value of each PAES component.

![Weightings Interface Evolution](./assets/weightings-interface-evolution.png)

**Interest Test Interface Evolution**

Initially, test questions showed their number and multiple-choice options, along with the total count in the center. In the updated version, a progress bar was added and a Likert scale was used, providing a clearer and more intuitive way to measure user interest.


![Interest Test Interface Evolution](./assets/interest-test-interface-evolution.png)

### 7.2. High Definition Interfaces

High-fidelity interfaces clearly showcase the project's visual style, content structure, and navigation flow. Additionally, animations and transitions are incorporated where appropriate, delivering a more realistic and immersive user experience.

**Key highlights:**

- A **cool color palette** was chosen to convey a sense of calm, trust, and clarity throughout the user‚Äôs navigation.
- Since certain elements are repeated across multiple screens, a set of **reusable components** was created to ensure visual consistency and simplify maintenance. These components include the filter bar, search bar, navigation bar, buttons, and more.
- **Component variants** were designed to reflect different **visual states**, especially for interactive elements. For instance, buttons change color on hover, clearly indicating their interactivity and encouraging user engagement.
