## Strategy
The first step taken by the team was to define the strategy through a "Value Proposition Canvas," used to align the user needs with the proposed solution. This process allowed us to clearly identify our target market—high school students facing challenges in choosing their future undergraduate program and develop a product tailored to their realities. From the canvas, we observed key alignments such as the “fear of making the wrong choice” and the corresponding feature “comparison tools with objective data.” This connection helped us understand how to support users through clarity and personalization. Other early ideas, like integrating external advising networks, were discussed but ultimately not prioritized in the current version. This strategic process helped ensure the solution is not only functional but directly addresses the students' pains, gains, and real decision-making contexts.

## Scope
### UX persona
The application is designed for high school students who are exploring their future undergraduate programs and need support in making informed decisions. It is suitable for students with clear interests as well as those who are still uncertain. It provides step-by-step guidance through vocational tests, undergraduate program exploration tools, and scholarship information. It allows users to reflect on their strengths, compare study options, and access relevant, real-world data. It also considers different user contexts and motivations, ensuring the experience feels personal and supportive. In short, it is a versatile application that helps students navigate their academic choices with clarity and confidence.

###Benchmarking
In order to develop an application that truly responds to the needs and expectations of high school students seeking vocational guidance, it was essential to conduct a thorough benchmarking analysis of existing platforms in the educational field. This process allowed us to evaluate the strengths and weaknesses of competing applications, such as Mifuturo, EligeCarrera, CarrerasUniversitarias, and BeneficiosEstudiantiles, identifying both useful features and areas for improvement.

Through this analysis, we recognized valuable elements to include in our product—such as scholarship search tools, personalized filters based on user profiles, and centralized access to undergraduate program and scholarship information. At the same time, we identified key pain points in existing platforms, such as unclear test results, excessive visual noise, and non-functional buttons, which we aim to eliminate from our own design.

By leveraging these insights, we are building an application that not only avoids the common pitfalls of existing tools but also enhances the user experience through features like undergraduate program comparisons, personalized recommendations, and notifications based on individual profiles. Benchmarking has therefore played a critical role in aligning our solution with both market standards and user-centered design principles, ensuring that Vocación360 delivers a clear, relevant, and empowering path toward informed academic decision-making.
